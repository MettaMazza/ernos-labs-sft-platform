"""Clean-room structural reconstruction of three-space and inverse-square dilution.

This module reconstructs the V2 questions without importing V2 proof artifacts or
external physical targets.  The direction is deliberately one-way:

    Fold recurrence -> generator three -> stable spatial count three
    -> boundary rank two -> inverse-square dilution -> measurement.

Host integers enumerate finite proof artifacts.  Admitted quantities are exact
positive counts, exact positive parts and held orientations; the empty One is
used for structural absence and never as a numerical proof value.
